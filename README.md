- 👋 Hi, I’m @MNDSE, in my previous life, I was a professional translator/ interpreter and project coordinator.
- I decided to give up all and go back to college to major in computer science. 
- 👀 I’m interested in web development
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to web development, database creation and management.
-     When I am not coding or learning, definitely I am watching football or working out :)
- 📫 Reach me at mndsezi@gmail.com...
